## Run locally

The notebook can of course also be run on your local computer using your own jupyter notebook server. Install such an environment e.g. via the extensive [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), the minimalistic [Miniconda distribution](https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html) or the extremely fast [Mamba package manager](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). (The order indicates preference by simplicity in installation and usage.)

You may find all required packages in the `environment.yml` file:

```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate nmap23
```
